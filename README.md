# The Store (Shirt Edition)

## It's a simple Next.js application with Shadcn Components
Since it's that simple, you just need to run two lines of code so you can test it:

```bash
npm install
```
So the dependencies can be downloaded and installed, and the command below to serve the app in a development environment.
```bash
npm run dev
```

## The "api"
To make things easier, we are going to use a fake api using `json-server`. To make use of it is simple, just run:
```bash
npm run db:serve
```
